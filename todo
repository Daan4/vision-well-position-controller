implement more evaluators: done, implemented hough transform, idk what else would be good
    - maybe add area as a metric for bottom features somehow?


implement evaluators in c: done for features algorithm, hough transform will just be in opencv
    - compare c vs opencv algorithm performance on a raspberry pi
    - optimize c implementation if needed (morphology seems to be the big one, maybe try a seperable kernel or optimize the function)


use QThread, slots and signals for position controller
    - acquire image frame from pivideostream when required
    - control motor position asynchronously

get some main function / interface going
