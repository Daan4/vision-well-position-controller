use a smaller kernel for morphological open, just to split up blobs
then use additional features for classification instead, like:
    signature
    centroid
    area
    axis of least moment
    eccentricity
    aspect ratio
    elongatedness
    moments

log as much data as possible (logging flag) to csv file to make plots for the report

log per application run in a csv file named with the date:
    timestamp, error for each evaluator, target coordinates, modified setpoint (+ known offset + randomized error)

logging added -> needs to be tested

convert pixel offset result to mm
